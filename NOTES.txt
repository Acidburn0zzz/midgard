    ✓ move all the existing JS into an "OLD" directory, to be ported one by one

    ✓ rewrite index.html to just load the real dependencies
    ✓ have the root render as a react component
    ✓ get the login logic from AN and port it to the model we have here
    ✓ render the login
    ✓ start porting over the rest piece by piece

    - keep track of last seen
    - show badges
    ✓ show list of mailboxes that depends on configured filters
    ✓ store/load filter preferences from user
