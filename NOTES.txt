    - apply clean-css
    - have all data access go through Fetch instead of the horrible jQuery API
    - switch all to ES6 by default
    - replace Handlebars with ES6 strings for the templating
    - add a "see more" link to those events in which it makes sense, and get rendered HTML as in
      https://developer.github.com/v3/media/. Or even just load it by default (from the client).
    - switch to the mailbox style, it's much cleaner
    - login errors should look like this:
